# CLRS C++ Implementations

Implementations of __Introduction to Algorithms__ by _Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein_ in C++.

I'm attempting to make an implementation of the algorithms in C++. Attempts are made to make the code as similar as possible to the pseudocode in the book. The algorithms are referenced by page number in the 3rd edition of the book, to make them easier to find. In case the algorithm is given in parts, the page number references the first part.
